# What pattern is used?

You are given 3 files (`PatternA`, `PatternB` & `PatternC`) which each implement a different design pattern.
Your task is to determine what pattern is used.

# Solution

Each _pattern file_ will have a comment block where you can write your answer and comments.

If you see `/* Write your answers and comments below this line */` you've found the rigth place :-)

## What you'll be evaluated on
You'll be evaluated on your ability to determine what pattern is used and explain its pros and cons.
Full points can be only be awarded if you explain which problems the pattern can solve and the pros and cons of the pattern.
