This test includes 8 assignments, which we want you to solve!

Please refrain from using the internet for scouting out solutions.
That is no fun! And we wont get a good sense of what you are actually capable of!

For C# a solution file with a project for each assignment is located in the "source" folder.

For Java individual src files are provided for each assignment.

Your delivery for this project should be a zipped version of the entire repository.

Good luck, and happy coding!

For a C# solution, .net Framework (4.6.1) and Visual Studio 2015 is necessary.

For a Java solution, Java 8 is required.
